# Merge Police
This repository is a collection of GitHub Actions workflows that can enforce your branching policy. The workflows are intended to be used as status checks on Pull Requests. When used in this way, your team will have guardrails to ensure they are merging from/to the correct branches.

## How To Use
If you know your team's preferred branching strategy, then simply visit the `.github/workflows/` folder and copy the workflow that matches your strategy.

You will likely want to alter the branch names to match your naming convention.
