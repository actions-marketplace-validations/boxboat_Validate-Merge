# Validate Merge
This repository hosts a GitHub Action that can enforce your branching policy. 

This action is intended to be used as a status check on Pull Requests. 
After you implement this, your team will have guardrails to ensure they are merging from/to the correct branches.

## How To Use
Check out [.github/workflows/](.github/workflows/) for an example of how to use this.
